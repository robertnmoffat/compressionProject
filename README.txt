1. open uncompressed to load first image
2. load second image to load second
3. compress image to compress and save first image
4. open compressed to load compressed file and display
5. generate motion vectors to print vectors, compress, uncompress, and then display

Number 5 isn't properly uncompressing the data.
I would like to do a demo in person after the break as we discussed.
